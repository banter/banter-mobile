In order to get started with this project, you'll need to have React Native and all of it's dependencies.

I'd recommend following [This Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)'s React Native CLI Quickstart setup. We do not use Expo.

Once you're all set up:

`npm i`, `npm start`, then open a new terminal window and `npm run ios`
